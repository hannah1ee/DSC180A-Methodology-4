**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter is how artificial intelligence could be used by researchers to replace animal testing in the intial phases. It was fascinating to hear and read how machine learning models can simulate biological responses and predict toxicity or drug efficacy, potentially reducing the need for live testing. This approach not only has ethical benefits but also makes the research process faster and more scalable. 

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
A potential investigation I'd like to pursue for my Quarter 2 project is how microbiome composition can be used to predict disease risk or lifestyle patterns. The human microbiome plays a crucial role in health and disease, but identifying which bacterial species serve as reliable biomarkers is still a challenge. The project would use public microbiome datasets, such as those from the Human Microbiome Project, to analyze bacterial community compositions across individuals and health conditions. 

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
A potential change I'd make to the approaches taken in my current Quarter 1 replication projects is to make the data input pipeline more structured and consistent. So far, our team has been using SemLib to parse through biomedical literature and a patient-doctor dataset, which works well for exploratory analysis but often leads to uneven data formats and incomplete context across sources. For the Quarter 2 project, I would standardized each article and dataset so that it is preprocessed and annotated before storing it to be analyzed. 

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
So far, using SemLib has been a great way to understand how models parse biomedical text and extract relationships between entities, but I'd like to dive deeper into the machine learning side that drives these outputs. Specifically, I want to explore clustering techniques (such as k-means or hierarchical clustering) to group similar research articles or molecular entities based on shared patterns in their embeddings. I'm also interested in experimenting with supervised learning models, like using logistic regression, random forests, or neural networks, to better understand how algorithms optimize their parameters and what contributes to their accuracy.
